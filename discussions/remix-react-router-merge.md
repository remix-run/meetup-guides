# Remix ➡️ React Router Merge

In case you didn't see the [announcement blog](https://remix.run/blog/merging-remix-and-react-router) or [followup blog](https://remix.run/blog/incremental-path-to-react-19), long story short we're merging what was Remix v3 into React Router v7.

To quote the first article

> TL;DR: React Router is getting everything that's great about Remix (and more!) in the next version. Remix users should keep using Remix and switch to React Router v7 when it's released by just changing the imports. We have plans for the future of the Remix packages we're excited to share as soon as we can.

You're probably wondering what this means for the meetups and what to do next. I plan to write more thoughts here, but in the meantime I'll just quote Kent from a Discord message:

> If my opinion matters at all, please please please do not encourage meetups to become React meetups. Keep the Remix name for all of them.
>
> The Remix nap will be very short I think! In terms of meetups, there will only be a handful of meetups that happen between now and when the Remix package is in use again.
>
> When this is all settled, it'll feel like it happened in a blink of an eye.
>
> (Even if it does take a year or whatever)
