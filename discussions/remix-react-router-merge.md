# Remix ➡️ React Router Merge

In case you didn't see the [announcement blog][announcement-blog] or [followup blog][followup-blog], we are merging Remix into React React Router. This inevitably brings up questions about the future of the Remix meetups.

## Are the meetups shutting down

Absolutely not, we love the meetups. As of writing this, the [Remix network][remix-network] on Meetup has:

- 3,823 members
- 15 groups
- 10 countries represented

I personally believe local tech communities are incredibly valuable in an increasingly digital world. They allow people to connect in meaningful ways, share ideas and get realtime (and typically more polite) feedback, and expand their circle of influence and friends in their city. Meetups also allow people to ask questions, learn something new, and practice giving technical talks in a less stressful environment than a big conference stage

## Should I rename my meetup to React Router Meetup

Nope! We are very set on keeping the Remix brand. To quote [Merging Remix and React Router][announcement-quote]

> As for the Remix brand, it's not going anywhere. We are the Remix team, React Router is a Remix project, and we have really exciting plans beyond React Router we can't wait to talk about.

And [Incremental Path to React 19: React Conf Follow-Up][followup-quote]

> We love Remix! The brand, the community, the ethos.

What does that even mean to "keep the brand" when we're seemingly taking a step backwards with the Remix packages?

We're taking a step backwards so we can take a step forward (see followup article for hints as to what this is). React Router is kind of boring, and a bit of that is by design. It's popular, but boring. We have some work to do to convince people that it is a web framework (a lot of that has to do with breaking down what people think a framework even is). But that's really not going to be prohibitor of it's adoption, because it is already so widely used and is going to be the only existing migration path to React 19 (RSC specifically) for the majority of apps.

So boring tech === good

That's not entirely the case for things like meetups though, where you're trying to entice people to come give you a few hours out of their lives.

So we're keeping the name Remix for the meetups as well. It's the parent team and ethos behind React Router, and everything that Remix has been is just a subset of what Remix will be. Plus, when the `remix` package comes back, it'll avoid us all switching our meetup names right back.

## How should I be marketing my meetup

This is where I hope we as meetup organizers can bounce off ideas.

For a time, I actually think the meetups might gain even more attention. There are likely a lot of people who have just now heard about Remix because of the announcement, or have a newfound interest in learning Remix since they're hearing that these features are coming to React Router. For the next few months we get to:

- Introduce people to Remix/React Router patterns and APIs
- Share about migration paths
- Address questions about the future of Remix
- Demo/announce React Router v7 when it comes out

For my meetup, I see a lot of easy talks that need to be given, which I'm excited to encourage new speakers to give.

More than that though, I think there's a good opportunity to focus on the Remix tagline:

> Build Better Websites

That's what Remix is about right now. The meetups still teach people how to build better websites. This doesn't change the fact that there are many developers who want to learn about databases, servers, deployment options, optimistic/pending ui, styling patterns, etc.

You as a meetup organizer are the on-the-ground eyes and ears of what people are wanting to learn, what they want to know, what makes sense about this announcement and what doesn't. Continuing these meetups is going to be incredibly valuable for the Remix team, because you will be able to give us some of the most important feedback we can get. In my economy, generally

1 IRL opinion === 10 twitter opinions

So I'm hoping we'll keep talking. Be honest and upfront with me. Tell me if it starts to suck organizing the Remix meetups. Tell me if attendees are struggling to get the message. Share successes you've seen, and ideas you have for us to make this better.

This repo is always open, if you have something you think should be here, or even just want to start a discussion: create a new markdown file, write it up, and submit a PR.

Thank you all for running these meetups. They have a very special place in my heart.
