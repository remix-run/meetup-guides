# Running a Successful Meetup

As a Remix Meetup organizer, you're empowered and responsible to run your meetup as you see fit. Cater your meetup to your attendees, city, and culture.

There's no "Remix Meetup" formula you have to follow. Many successful meetups incorporate these 4 elements elements:

- A consistent location
- A consistent schedule (e.g. first Wednesday of the month)
- A speaker/central activity
- Food/drinks

There are meetups that also have their own websites, run hackathons, and cross-organize with other meetups. This guide is a starting point for those new to organizing a meetup. This guide is also a place for other meetup organizers to share any tips and tricks they've learned.

If you feel like something is missing, please open up a PR and contribute.

## How do I get people to come?

For most meetups, getting people to come is about 2 things:

1. Marketing
2. Consistency

Marketing gets people in the door. Providing a good and consistent experience is what gets people to come back. This section focuses specifically on marketing and the various channels organizers have found successful.

### Meetup.com

[Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) is not perfect, but one thing it's good about is giving your meetup/events reach. This is the first layer of marketing, and you'll likely add more layers as you go.

Schedule your meetup at least 2 weeks in advance. Some meetups schedule the next 2-3 meetups in advance, which helps people plan for them and also signals that you are running a healthy meetup

### Twitter/X

Twitter/X can be a nice additional marketing channel, depending on your reach. Many people choose to stay off Twitter, which is very understandable. For better or worse, a large portion of the tech community is on Twitter. Additionally, if you have an online presence to your meetup that you want to grow, there are many developers on Twitter who aren't lucky enough to have a Remix Meetup near them that would love to join yours virtually.

If you do post about your Meetup on Twitter, be sure to tag [@remix_run](https://x.com/remix_run) so someone on the Remix team can retweet it.

### Email

Meetup allows you to email your members. As your Meetup grows, you may be hesitant to send an email to hundreds of people asking them to come to your Meetup. Remember, people joined your Meetup group for a reason. Even if they haven't come yet, they may still be intending to, and a quick email the Monday before your event, or sometime in the week prior, can be a really effective reminder.

Here's an [email template](./templates/meetup-email.md) to show you how simple it is. The key is to make it engaging, to-the-point, and actionable. Make it fun and inviting, but don't make it incredibly verbose, and most importantly have a call-to-action to RSVP.

### Remix Discord

Every meetup has a channel inside the [Remix Discord](https://rmx.as/discord) (if you don't, please bug Brooks Lybrand). This is your space to do what you want with. Some meetups use it to communicate and plan, others use it to ask questions, and others use it as just another marketing channel to post where there's a new event.

No matter how you want to use it, it's recommended to at least post when you've scheduled a new event.

## How do I get people to speak?

Feel free to copy this [talk proposal template](./templates/talk-proposal.md) and edit it to fit your needs. Many meetup organizers use [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) since it's easy and free, but feel free to use whatever you'd like.
