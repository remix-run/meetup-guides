# Running a Successful Meetup

The cool thing about Remix Meetups is there's no formula, every organizer gets to run their meetup how they see fit. Cater your meetup to your city, culture, attendees, etc.

That being said, all meetups typically have the same elements:

- A location
- A speaker/central activity
- Food/drinks
- A schedule
