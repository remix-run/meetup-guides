# Remix Meetup Guides

ðŸš§ This document/repo is currently under progress. The plan is to build a handful of resources for running a Meetup that will be useful for other organizers ðŸš§

This repository is a collection of guides for running a Remix meetup.

Remix meetups are community-run groups [all around the globe](https://www.meetup.com/pro/remix-run/) where people can learn, share, and collaborate on Remix projects.

All meetups and especially meetup organizers must abide by the Remix [code of conduct](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Feel free to copy and use this CoC for your own meetup.

## I want to start a meetup

Great! We're excited for you to create space for people to explore Remix in community.
