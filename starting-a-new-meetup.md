# Starting a New Remix Meetup

Welcome!

If you're reading this guide, that means you're interested in starting a [Remix meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pro/remix-run/)

There are a few other docs in this repo to help you run a successful meetup, but to get started you just need to follow these simple steps

1. [Find a host location](./running-a-successful-meetup.md#how-do-i-find-a-hostsponsor) to meet, ideally somewhere you can meet monthly
2. (optional) Find a company/someone who will sponsor food as a motivation for attendees to checkout the group
3. When you're ready, reach out to Brooks Lybrand on the Remix team and he'll give you a token to create a meetup group as part of the larger Remix pro group. Remix will pay for the monthly pro meetup account
4. [Find a speaker](./running-a-successful-meetup.md#how-do-i-get-people-to-speak) or come up with a workshop/project for the first meetup
5. Schedule your first meetup
