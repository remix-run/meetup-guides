Join us for some free food, networking, and presentations! Meetups are a great way to connect with the community and learn from each other.

**Schedule:**

- 7:00: Greetings and food (Whatever you're catering)
- 7:30: Speaker: TOPIC. Description
- 8:30: Chat until we're kicked out

**Want to Present?**

You do not have to be an expert to present, it doesn't have to be about Remix specifically, and it can be a short presentation! It's one of the best ways to force yourself to learn something new and solidify what you've been learning.

Please fill out this form [LINK A FORM] to volunteer to present. Filling out the form isn't necessarily a commitment to speak, so even if you _might_ be interested, please fill it out!

**Sponsors**

Thank you to [SPONSOR] for giving us a space and providing the food!
